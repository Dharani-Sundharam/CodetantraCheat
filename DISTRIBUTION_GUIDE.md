## ðŸ“¦ How to Create a Distribution Package

### Step 1: Prepare the Files
Make sure you have all the necessary files in your project folder:

```
CodeTantraAutomation/
â”œâ”€â”€ desktop-app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ automation_runner.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api_client.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config_manager.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ code_question_handler.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ comment_remover.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ codetantra_playwright.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ credentials_template.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ credentials.py (empty template)
â”œâ”€â”€ install.bat
â”œâ”€â”€ run.bat
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ DISTRIBUTION_GUIDE.md
```

### Step 2: Create the Zip Package
1. **Select all files** in the main folder
2. **Right-click** and choose "Send to" â†’ "Compressed (zipped) folder"
3. **Name it** something like `CodeTantraAutomation_v1.0.zip`

### Step 3: Test the Distribution
1. **Extract** the zip to a test folder
2. **Run** `install.bat` to verify installation works
3. **Run** `run.bat` to verify the application starts
4. **Check** that disclaimer appears and credentials need setup

## ðŸŽ¯ User Instructions (Include with Distribution)

### For End Users:
1. **Extract** the zip file to any folder
2. **Run** `install.bat` as Administrator (if needed)
3. **Copy** `desktop-app/credentials_template.py` to `desktop-app/credentials.py`
4. **Edit** `desktop-app/credentials.py` with your account details
5. **Run** `run.bat` to start the application
6. **Accept** the disclaimer to continue

### System Requirements:
- Windows 10/11
- Python 3.8+ (will be checked during installation)
- Internet connection (for browser installation)
- Administrator rights (for browser installation)
