# Complete Setup Guide - Code Tantra Automation

## üìã What You Need

- Windows PC (or Mac/Linux with minor adjustments)
- Python 3.7 or higher installed
- Firefox browser installed
- Two Code Tantra accounts:
  - One with completed problems (answers)
  - One where you want to submit

## üéØ Your Accounts

Based on your setup:
- **Answers Account**: `mfra.ece2024@rmd.ac.in`
- **Target Account**: `gdha.ece2024@rmd.ac.in`
- **Login URL**: https://rmd.codetantra.com/login.jsp

## üì¶ Installation

### Step 1: Verify Python
Open Command Prompt (cmd) and type:
```bash
python --version
```
You should see Python 3.7 or higher. If not, download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
In your project folder, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs:
- `selenium` - Browser automation
- `webdriver-manager` - Automatic Firefox driver management

### Step 3: Verify Firefox
Make sure Firefox is installed on your computer. The script uses Firefox because Code Tantra allows copy-paste in Firefox browsers.

## üîê Configure Credentials

Your credentials are already set in `credentials.py`:

```python
LOGIN_URL = "https://rmd.codetantra.com/login.jsp"

ANSWERS_ACCOUNT = {
    'username': 'mfra.ece2024@rmd.ac.in',
    'password': 'Rmdec@2001'
}

TARGET_ACCOUNT = {
    'username': 'gdha.ece2024@rmd.ac.in',
    'password': 'Dharani$#@!1'
}
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY WARNING**:
- Never share `credentials.py`
- Never commit it to Git (it's in `.gitignore`)
- Keep it secure on your local machine

## üöÄ Running the Tool

### Quick Start (Using run.bat)
1. Double-click `run.bat`
2. Wait for two Firefox windows to open
3. Wait for automatic login to complete
4. Navigate both accounts to the problems section
5. Press ENTER when ready

### Manual Start
```bash

## üéÆ Controls

- **Press Ctrl+C** at any time to stop the automation
- The script will complete the current problem before stopping
- You can watch both windows to monitor progress

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Login Fails
**Problem**: Script says "Login may have failed"
**Solutions**:
1. Check credentials in `credentials.py` are correct
2. Try logging in manually in a browser first
3. Check if account is locked or requires password reset

### Can't Find Next Button
**Problem**: "Could not find Next button"
**Solutions**:
1. Script now auto-scrolls - give it a moment
2. Make sure you're on the problems page
3. Some pages might not have Next button (end of list)

### Code Not Pasting
**Problem**: Code doesn't appear in target account
**Solutions**:
1. Make sure Firefox is being used (not Chrome)
2. Check if Code Tantra page has loaded completely
3. Try increasing delays in `config.py`

### Submission Fails
**Problem**: Submission shows error or timeout
**Solutions**:
1. Check if the code in answers account is actually correct
2. Some problems have specific requirements
3. Website might be slow - increase `SUBMIT_DELAY` in `config.py`

### Firefox Doesn't Open
**Problem**: Script fails to start Firefox
**Solutions**:
1. Make sure Firefox is installed
2. Restart your computer
3. Try reinstalling Firefox
4. Check if geckodriver needs updating: `pip install --upgrade selenium`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

Edit `config.py` to change:

```python
# Window sizes
WINDOW_WIDTH = 960
WINDOW_HEIGHT = 1080

# Timing (in seconds)
SYNC_DELAY = 2
SUBMIT_DELAY = 3
PAGE_LOAD_DELAY = 2

# Maximum sync attempts
MAX_SYNC_ATTEMPTS = 20
```

## üìä Features Explained

### 1. Smart Scrolling
The script automatically scrolls to find buttons anywhere on the page. If Next/Prev/Submit buttons are below the fold, it will find them.

### 2. Problem Synchronization
Compares the problem titles in both accounts to ensure they're working on the same problem. Automatically navigates if they're different.

### 3. Code Extraction
Reads code from the CodeMirror editor in the answers account, preserving formatting and special characters.

### 4. Intelligent Pasting
Pastes code line-by-line to avoid issues with special characters or formatting.

### 5. Submission Verification
Checks for the green success badge to confirm submission worked. Continues even if some fail.

## üìù Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Test with 1-2 problems first
2. **Monitor Progress**: Watch both windows during execution
3. **Backup Work**: Keep a copy of your code elsewhere
4. **Academic Integrity**: Use responsibly for learning purposes
5. **Keep Updated**: Update dependencies occasionally with `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`

## üÜò Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check this guide first
2. Look at error messages in the console
3. Try running with fewer problems first
4. Check Code Tantra website hasn't changed structure
5. Verify credentials are correct
