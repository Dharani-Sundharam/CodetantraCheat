# Desktop App Credit System - Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed API Problem Number Issue
- **Problem**: Backend was expecting `problem_number` as integer but receiving strings like "1.1.2"
- **Solution**: Removed `problem_number` from API calls entirely (not needed for credit deduction)

### 2. Simplified Credit Deduction Flow
- **Old Approach**: Tried to deduct credits during automation for each problem
- **New Approach**: Calculate and deduct ALL credits AFTER automation completes

### 3. Credit Calculation Logic

**After automation finishes:**
- **Solved Problems**: 5 credits each (assumed to be code_completion)
- **Failed Problems**: 1 credit each
- **Skipped Problems**: 1 credit each

**Example:**
```
Problems solved: 10 x 5 credits = 50 credits
Problems failed/skipped: 2 x 1 credit = 2 credits
Total credits to deduct: 52 credits
```

### 4. API Integration

**Credit Deduction Process:**
1. Automation completes and provides final report
2. Calculate total credits based on results
3. Make multiple API calls to `/api/credits/deduct`:
   - One call for each solved problem (5 credits)
   - One call for each failed problem (1 credit)
   - One call for each skipped problem (1 credit)
4. Display updated credit balance in desktop app

**API Call Format:**
```json
{
  "problem_type": "code_completion",
  "success": true/false,
  "problem_number": null
}
```

### 5. User Experience Flow

1. User clicks "Start Automation" or "Endless Mode"
2. Automation runs (user sees console logs in the UI)
3. If accounts are on different problems, automation prompts user to align them
4. User manually navigates both accounts to the same problem
5. User presses ENTER in the console prompt
6. Automation continues and solves problems
7. **After completion**: Desktop app calculates and deducts credits
8. Desktop app shows credit summary and updated balance

### 6. Error Handling

**If API is down:**
- Desktop app shows warning message
- Credits are NOT deducted
- User can still see automation results
- Message displayed: "Please ensure the website is accessible and try again later"

**If credit deduction fails:**
- App logs the error but continues
- Shows warning for each failed credit deduction
- User can manually contact support

### 7. Credit Requirements & Validation

#### Normal Mode:
- **Minimum**: 1 credit to start
- **Warning**: If credits < estimated needs, shows warning but continues
- **During deduction**: Stops if credits run out

#### Endless Mode:
- **Minimum Required**: 50 credits to start
- **Purpose**: Ensures user can solve at least 10 problems (10 × 5 = 50 credits)
- **Error**: Shows clear error message if user has < 50 credits

### 8. Edge Case Handling

**If credits run out during deduction:**
```
Current credits: 23
Trying to deduct for 10 solved problems (50 credits needed)
- Deducts for 4 problems (20 credits)
- Stops at problem 5 (only 3 credits left, need 5)
- Sets final credits to 3 (never goes below 0)
```

**Credit Safety:**
- Checks credits before each deduction
- Stops if insufficient credits
- Never allows negative credits
- Logs warnings when credits run low

### 9. Files Modified

#### `desktop-app/automation_runner.py`
- Removed complex `run_automation_with_credits()` method
- Added simple `deduct_credits_after_completion()` method
- Added credit validation before starting automation
- Added 50 credit requirement for endless mode
- Credits are calculated and deducted AFTER automation finishes
- Prevents credits from going below 0
- Shows detailed credit calculation summary in logs

#### `desktop-app/main.py`
- No changes needed (already had proper UI flow)
- Credits are refreshed after automation completes

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run automation with 5 problems
- [ ] Verify credits are deducted correctly (5 per solved, 1 per failed/skipped)
- [ ] Check if API down warning appears when server is not accessible
- [ ] Verify credits display updates in desktop app after automation
- [ ] Test endless mode credit deduction
- [ ] Verify web dashboard shows updated credits after desktop app usage

## API Endpoint Used

**POST** `/api/credits/deduct`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "problem_type": "code_completion",
  "success": true,
  "problem_number": null
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Credits deducted successfully",
  "credits_deducted": 5,
  "remaining_credits": 45
}
```

## Benefits of New Approach

1. ✅ **Simpler**: No complex tracking during automation
2. ✅ **More Reliable**: Credits deducted in batch after completion
3. ✅ **Better Error Handling**: Can retry credit deduction if needed
4. ✅ **Cleaner Logs**: Credit calculation shown separately
5. ✅ **No API Parsing Errors**: No problem_number sent to API

## Known Limitations

1. **Assumes all solved problems are code_completion**: Currently deducts 5 credits for all solved problems
   - Future enhancement: Track problem types during automation
2. **Multiple API calls**: Makes separate call for each problem
   - Future enhancement: Batch credit deduction API endpoint

## Future Enhancements

1. Track problem types during automation (code vs. other)
2. Create batch credit deduction endpoint
3. Add retry logic for failed API calls
4. Store credit deduction history locally for offline review
